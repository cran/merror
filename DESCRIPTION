Title: Accuracy and Precision of Measurements
Description: N>=3 methods are used to measure each of n items. 
 The data are used to estimate simultaneously systematic error (bias)
 and random error (imprecision). Observed measurements for each method
 or device are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
 and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Maximum likelihood 
 estimation is used for the imprecision standard deviation estimates. 
 Pairwise calibration curves and plots can be easily generated.
